            Very few laboratory technologists of India realized that this
            particular category was very much neglected by the authorities. So
            they came forward and joined hands and established Indian Medical
            Laboratory Technologists Association in the year 1970.the name
            changed to "ALL INDIA MEDICAL LABORATORY TECHNOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION"
            with its Headquarters at New Delhi. Later the constitution of the
            association was introduced to see the development of the cadre. The
            founder members of this association visited most of the States,
            Hospitals and Medical Colleges with the idea to bring all Laboratory
            Technologists on one platform to give strength to the Association.
            The membership started increasing and more and more people started
            joining the association. The Central Committee constituted States
            units in many States with its office bearers to look after the
            matter of their own state under the guidance of Central committee.
            The first All India Conference was organized at All India Institute
            of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The second at Patna and the third
            was at Kolkata and to hold All India Conferences every year and in
            different states became a continuous process which is continuing. As
            the membership increased the need of formation of Council for
            Medical Laboratory Technologists was felt and at the same time to
            increase the qualifications of the in-service personal was also
            realized and thus immediately two Committees constituted one for
            Council and other for Academic Board
